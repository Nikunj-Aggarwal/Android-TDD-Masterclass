### What is TDD
* In this repo you will find Mockito examples.

### Advantages of TDD
#### Great understanding of the product requirements.
First of all we get the great product understanding. When we force ourselves to write the test before we write the implementation we get to think of all the factors that will make our product successful , at this point we also realize very early that certain user stories do not meet the definition of ready and we need to clarify many ambiguities with the product owner and the designers.
#### Faster Development.
While at first it may seem overwhelming in the long run , we get to develop much faster. Just think how much time you spent debugging your application.
Even worse, how much time you are going to spend if the defected code was written by someone else a long time ago. With TDD we minimize and almost eliminate the time we spend using the debugger.
#### Better Design : High cohesion , Low coupling.
Another advantage of TDD is that we get to produce high quality code with high cohesion and low coupling when those two conditions are not met writing test is really difficult. By writing the test first we are making sure that our application is meeting all the conditions to be easily testable. Easy to test also means easy to read and easy to maintain.
#### Less Defects.
A system developed with test driven development is going to have much less defects.
#### Promotes Quality Culture.
A very important side effect of practicing TDD is that promotes a high quality culture inside the organization . TDD is a direct opposite of the quick and dirty that has destroyed a lot of projects even companies in the long run.
Practicing test driven development on a massive scale within the oraganization guarantees the success of the project in the long run and therefore the retention of its customers . Furthermore it attracts top talent and top software engineers who realize the benefits of working on such a high level.
####  Regression Test Suite.
Another massive advantage is that we inherit for free a great regression test suit that is going to assure that newly introduce changes have not broken past behavior. How many times have you released a new version of the production and realized months later that the old features are not working anymore?
Having an automated test suit in place in the best tool to avoid those situations.
####  Documentation
We are getting documentation for free , there is no better documentation than the one which doesn't only describes what the system is doing but it is also assuring that the system works.
